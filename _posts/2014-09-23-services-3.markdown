Georgetown is 23 miles north of downtown Austin.  Driving on I-35, head north for about 30 minutes and the venue is a short distance from the highway exit.  We are happy to facilitate carpools, and will be renting a shuttle on the day of the wedding for those who are interested. We'll have a sign-up available for the shuttle as the date approaches. 

Update: [Uber and Lyft will return to Austin](http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-uber-austin-20170529-story.html)   

We'd like to hear from you about your transportation needs in order to make the event safe and fun for everyone!
